**Getting Started:**

1. **Download:** Head over to our [GitHub](https://github.com/mochensky/Sticker-Informer/releases/latest) page and grab the latest version.
2. **Extract and Run:** Unzip the downloaded file and double-click on `Sticker-Informer.exe` to launch the program. (Bonus points for creating a desktop shortcut!)
3. **Configure & Go!** Once the program loads, simply enter your Discord webhook URL and adjust the check delay settings. Now, fire up Natro Macro, and let Sticker-Informer keep you informed about your sticker haul!


**Important Notes:**

* **Accuracy Matters:** Since Sticker-Informer uses a neural network, there might be occasional misinterpretations, especially due to in-game elements like the Sticker Printer. 
* **Natro Macro Match:** This tool works best when running alongside Natro Macro. 
* **Performance Check:** While not too demanding,  Sticker-Informer might not run smoothly on very weak computers. However, if you can play with `3+` graphics in Bee Swarm Simulator, you're good to go!

**Usage Tips:**
1. **Font:** Don't use custom fonts in Roblox. This may cause the program to not work at all.
2. **Usage:** Use Sticker-Informer only with Natro Macro, because otherwise it will work on everything that is possible.
 
**Disclaimer:**

* This tool is designed for personal use and enjoyment only.
* Remember, using automation tools might violate Roblox's terms of service. Use Sticker-Informer responsibly and at your own risk.
