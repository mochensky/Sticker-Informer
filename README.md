## Sticker-Informer: A Bee Swarm Simulator Tool

### Overview
Sticker-Informer is a Python-based automation tool designed to enhance gameplay in Roblox's Bee Swarm Simulator. It functions as an add-on for the Natro Macro, leveraging image recognition powered by neural networks to detect specific in-game elements. Once an image is identified, the program sends a notification to a designated Discord webhook, alerting the user to the detected event.

### Functionality
* **Detect:** Detects receipt of a _sticker_ in Bee Swarm Simulator.
* **Discord Integration:** Sending a message with information on behalf of Discord Webhook integration.

### Technical Details
* **Programming Language:** Python.
* **Platform Compatibility:** Tested on Windows 10 and 11 operating systems.

### Installation
1. Install the latest release from [github](https://github.com/mochensky/Sticker-Informer/releases/latest).
2. Create a new folder and extract the contents of the downloaded archive to the created folder.
3. Double-click on the file `Sticker-Informer.exe `in order to run the program. (For convenience, you can create a desktop shortcut that refers to this exe file)

### Usage
1. After starting, wait for some time for the program to fully load.
2. Enter all the necessary information that is required of you (the url of the webhook, the name of the game process, the name of the window, the check delay).
3. Now you can turn on Natro Macro, information about which stickers you receive and what will be sent to you from Discord Webhook.

### Problems
* Because a neural network is used for detection, sometimes there may be errors associated with poor detection. For example, when someone uses a Sticker Printer, or when there are similar items on the screen.
* It is strongly recommended to use this program only while Natro Macro is running.
* The program is not demanding enough, but still requires a not very weak computer. You don't have to worry about performance if you can afford to play on `3+` graphics in Bee Swarm Simulator.
