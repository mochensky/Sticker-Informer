## Sticker-Informer: A Bee Swarm Simulator Tool

### Overview
Sticker-Informer is a Python-based automation tool designed to enhance gameplay in Roblox's Bee Swarm Simulator. It functions as an add-on for the Natro Macro program, leveraging image recognition powered by neural networks to detect specific in-game elements. Once an image is identified, the program sends a notification to a designated Discord webhook, alerting the user to the detected event.

### Functionality
* **Image Recognition:** Employs neural networks to analyze the Bee Swarm Simulator game window.
* **Event Detection:** Identifies predefined images or patterns within the game, such as the appearance of specific stickers or items.
* **Discord Integration:** Sends real-time notifications to a specified Discord webhook, providing users with immediate updates on detected events.

### Technical Details
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Image Processing:** Utilizes a suitable computer vision library (e.g., OpenCV) for image analysis and feature extraction.
* **Neural Networks:** Leverages a pre-trained neural network or trains a custom model to achieve desired image recognition accuracy.
* **Platform Compatibility:** Tested on Windows 10 and 11 operating systems.
* **Dependencies:** Requires Natro Macro and other Python libraries for image processing, neural networks, and Discord interactions.

### Usage
1. **Installation:** Ensure Python and necessary libraries are installed. Download and install Natro Macro.
2. **Configuration:** Set up the Discord webhook URL and specify the images or patterns to be detected.
3. **Execution:** Run the Sticker-Informer script, and it will continuously monitor the Bee Swarm Simulator game window.

### Potential Use Cases
* **Sticker Farming:** Automatically detects the appearance of rare or valuable stickers.
* **Item Tracking:** Monitors for specific items or events within the game.
* **Automation:** Can be used to trigger automated actions based on detected events (e.g., using keyboard shortcuts).

### Future Enhancements
* **Customizable Detection:** Allow users to define custom image detection criteria.
* **Multiple Games:** Expand compatibility to support other Roblox games or similar titles.
* **Machine Learning:** Implement more advanced machine learning techniques for improved accuracy and adaptability.
